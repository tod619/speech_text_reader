# speech_text_reader

## Description

A text to speech reader with example cards. The system uses the speech synthesis api to read the text on the card and repeat the text back to the user. The system allows the user to create their own message in the dropdown text box and press the read button, which causes the system to repeat the typed message back to the user.
